# Summary
One rcomendation that could be addressed with the CEO is considering sending additional drivers to the Urban cities throughout the year. The Urban cities produce the most amount of revenue due to the higher demand - higher populated areas with more businesses and other economic destinations. The Ride-Sharing in the Urban city is less likely to compete with car owners of the smaller market share. This could increase the opportunity of providing rides for more people. 
Another recomendation for the CEO for addressing the disparities among the city types is to increase the amount of drivers available in all city types Urban, Suburban, and Rural thorugh the month of February. This is the month with the highest spike in total fares collected from each city type. 
The last recomendation would be to collect additional information about each ride such as the distance traveled for each fare. This could provide insight as to why the Rural fares have a much higher rate per ride compared to the Urban rates. The Rural areas have a higher competetion between the ride-sharing and car owners. The rural car owners whom are likely to travel greater distances have a less need to pay high rates over owning a vehicle.
